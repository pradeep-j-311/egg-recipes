# Egg recipes 

This is a project that is meant to practice some basic HTML code. The basics of HTML that are to be covered with this project are the following: 
- Structuring a basic website with HTML (file structures).
- Including title, head, body, paragraphs in a HTML document.
- Incorporating lists into the website (ordered, unordered).
- Making certain pieces of text have greater importance (strong, em).
- Including images in a webpage.
- Linking external and local web pages together.

The website itself is a simple website that provides some information on simple recipes that have eggs as its primary ingredient. The source of the recipes can be found at https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/search?q=eggs. For more recipes, visit their website.
